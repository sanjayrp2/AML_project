## About the Project 

Spotify Hit Prediction using machine learning algorithms is a mini-project based on song hit prediction in spotify for every week, designed and developed for Advanced Machine Learning course as mini project and also for various competitions and hackathons. This project discover how AI decodes the playlist that have been played the most in a week, and also predicts the hit song every week.

- ## Algorithms used :

  - Logistic Regression    
  -	Support Vector Machine  
  - Random Forest           


## Features 

-  **Hit Prediction** : Enhance user experience with our AI-based hit song prediction of the week.
-  **Rich Dataset** : Train your models with our extensive collection of spotify playlist.
-  **Interactive Analysis** : Explore data insights through comprehensive Jupyter notebook visualizations.
